//NOTE TIME:
//ok so make core data set up with an abstract(maybe not at first) activity class
//attributes being a CLLocation array (this has a timestamp so not postime stuff needed)

//next make certain classes to be for certian activities such as run, hike, where theey calculate a useful stat about it like pace.

//only thing im worried about is CLLocation being encoded.
